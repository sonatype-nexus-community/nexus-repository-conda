## Conda Repositories

### Introduction

[Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) provides Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R, 
Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN.

### Installing Conda

Full documentation on installing `conda` can be found on [the Conda project website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda).

### Proxying The Conda Continuum repository

You can create a proxy repository in Nexus Repository Manager that will cache packages from a remote anaconda repository, like
[Continuum](https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs). Then, you can make the `conda` client use your Nexus Repository Proxy 
instead of the remote repository.
 
To proxy a Conda repository, you simply create a new 'conda (proxy)' as documented in 
[Repository Management](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/configuration/repository-management) in
detail. Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name' - e.g. `conda-proxy`
- Define URL for 'Remote storage' e.g. [https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/](https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/)

Using the `conda` client, you can now download packages from your Nexus Conda proxy like so:

    $ conda install -c http://localhost:8081/repository/conda-proxy/main numpy
    
The command above tells conda to fetch (and install) packages from your Nexus Conda proxy. The Nexus Conda proxy will 
download any missing packages from the remote Conda repository, and cache the packages on the Nexus Conda proxy.
The next time any client requests the same package from your Nexus Conda proxy, the already cached package will
be returned to the client.
